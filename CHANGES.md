# Note

Changes must be logged in wf68k30L_top.vhd and the description changes there should be duplicated to README.md with added authors' names added both to the wf68k30L_top.vhd and COPYRIGHT.md file.  The Markdown files README.md, COPYRIGHT.md and LICENSE.md are just for convenience on the GitHub platform.  When in doubt, the wf68k30L_top.vhd file takes precedence over the files listed above.
